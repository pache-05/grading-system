# School Grading System

This project implements a simple school grading system to help teachers, administrators, and students easily check and manage student grades. The system is designed to calculate and display the final grade of a student based on their scores in different subjects or assessments.

## Features

- **Student Grade Calculation**: Allows teachers or administrators to input scores and calculate the final grade for each student.
- **Grade Classification**: Converts the raw score into a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.), based on predefined thresholds.
- **Grade Reporting**: Generates reports displaying a student's grade in each subject or overall.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports input of multiple subjects or assignments for each student.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for both admins and students.

## How It Works

1. **Input Student Data**: Admins or teachers input student details, including their scores for different subjects or assignments.
2. **Grade Calculation**: The system calculates the final grade based on a weighted average or preset rules.
3. **Display Grades**: The grade is displayed in letter format (A, B, C, etc.), along with the numerical score.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend logic)
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing student grades and data)
- **Interface**: Command-line interface (CLI)

## Installation

To run the grading system on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-grading-system.git
   ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the grading system:
   ```bash
   python grading_system.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Add Student**: To add a new student, you can enter their name and input their grades for various subjects.
   
2. **View Grades**: You can query for a specific student's grades by entering their name or student ID.

3. **Grade Calculation**: The system will calculate the final grade based on the defined thresholds and display it.

Example:

```python
Student Name: John Doe
Math Score: 85
English Score: 90
History Score: 88
Final Grade: B
```

## Grade Thresholds

The following grading scale is used to assign letter grades based on the percentage score:

- A: 90% - 100%
- B: 80% - 89%
- C: 70% - 79%
- D: 60% - 69%
- F: 0% - 59%
